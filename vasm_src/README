This directory contains all of the files necessary to compile
the VASM assembler.

Type 'make vasm' to compile the object file.

After compiling vasm, the command

	vasm file.asm

will read the VeSPA assembly language file file.asm.  It will produce
the file v.out, which can be read by the Verilog simulator that you
have simulating your VeSPA processor model.
